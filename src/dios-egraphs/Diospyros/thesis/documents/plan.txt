Hi Professor Sampson,

I apologize for the very late response. I agree I should start working on writing my thesis,
and I'm not particularly sure where to start. I looked at prior student's masters' thesis, and I 
was thinking that perhaps the background / previous work / related works could be written first? 

I also saw that other students used the basic structure of having an abstract, introduction,
background, implementation, evaluation and conclusion structure. Is this something I should aim to 
follow as well?

As for my project, I have not made any progress. I feel that I do not have a good idea of what
my research question is. 

Thank you for the advice! In my last semester, I would be interested in doing some more hacking / experimentation. 
I'm not sure what direction to go towards, though I imagine showing some speed up using Disopyros would be a first step. But I'm also not sure how far I can get with my current project based on my rate of progress. 
I would find it very helpful if we would be able to meet synchronously sometime. 


Plan for Next Semester
- Interested in doing more with Diospyros
- Exploring different heuristics

Current Work:
- I was reading papers relating to Diospyros, Autovectorization, Equality Saturation
- Interested in papers that use some sort of solving/rewritings
- liked equality saturation papers like carpentry
- Notice 
- Curious if there are better heuristics for better autovectorization

- feel uncomfortable with c++
- Want to improve Diospyros performance
- Come up with some systems idea and implement it

Problems:
Not handling unstructured work well, particularly what to do next


Ideas by December 12th
Come up with week by week plan
- Literature survey of vectorization (~40 papers I've read)
- Continue Diospyros equality saturation but for llvm in general
- Implement and compare 2 llvm models of heuristics
