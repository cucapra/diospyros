FFT is likely going to break, because the temps are ordered in a fashion that 
they cannot be moved before vectorization; need an algorithm 
to decide conservatively when vectorization can be done and on which sets of code.

Likewise, loop unrolling will likely break most vectorization outputs, because the
temps will straddle vector adds.

E.g.
temp  = 3 + 4;
v += temp 

temp = 5 + 6;
v += temp
might break when it is unrolled out.
