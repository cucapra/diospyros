# Diospyros

Compile code for DSPs.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Racket][] > 7.4
- Install [Rosette][] by running `raco pkg install rosette`.
- Install Racket's threading library with `raco pkg install threading`
- Install [Z3][] and [Boolector][].
- To run tests, install [runt][] by running `cargo install runt`. This also requires
  installing [Rust][].

## Building

Create executables to (1) create kernels in the DSL (`dios-example-gen`), and (2) compile kernels from the DSL to C (`dios`) with:
> make build

To make a DSL example, you'll need a JSON parameters file. For example:
```
{
  "input-rows": 2,
  "input-cols": 2,
  "filter-rows": 2,
  "filter-cols": 2,
  "iterations": 10,
  "reg-size": 4
}
```

Then run:
> ./dios-example-gen -b 2d-conv -p 2d-conv-params.json -o example-output.rkt

To compile from the DSL to C:
> ./dios -o example.c example-output.rkt

## Testing

### Integration tests

We use [runt][] for snapshot testing. Simply type `runt` in the repository root
to run tests. Use the following to update expect files generated by runt:

- **-d, --diff**: Show the diffs for the missing or failing tests.
- **-s, --save**: Update the results for the missing or failing tests.
- **-o, --only**: Filter the outputs to only display the given class of tests
  (miss, fail, pass). Composes with diff and save. For example, to only save
  the results for the missing files, do `runt -s -o miss`.

### Unit tests

To run the inline racket tests in the codebase:
```
make test-all
```
